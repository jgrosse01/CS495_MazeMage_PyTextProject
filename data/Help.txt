Welcome to the Maze Mage help menu!
  This is a game where you play as a newfound mage discovering their power while trapped in a maze. Your goal is to defeat enemies, find items/spells, and acquire the key to get out of the maze from the exit room.
  There are three types of enemies in this game, Skeletons, Specters, and Atronachs. You must refer to them accordingly when casting spells.
  There are three types of items in this game, Keys, which will be quite rare, MP Flasks to improve your maximum mana and mana regen, and HP Flasks to improve your HP regen.
  You will have an inventory to store items in limitless quantities; therefore, you must actively use the items in your inventory to acquire their benefits.
