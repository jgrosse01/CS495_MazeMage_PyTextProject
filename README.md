Welcome to "Maze Mage"
This is a solo project currently being used for CS-495: Computer Science Seminar at Carroll College.

The goal is to make a text based python program. We were given two days for the project in conjunction with several other classes in our schedules.
The minimum for a grade of "C" or meeting the bare minimum requirement to make a text based python program would to code a hello world program.

To get a better score than that the requirements are as follows:
1. Code the following (or something more complex for a better grade): print("Hello World!")
2. Writing 100% of the code without help or outside resources.
3. Code runs without error and give expected results.
4. Invalid user inputs are handled properly and there are no unhandled exceptions.
5. Code is formatted nicely.
6. Any sources are cited.
7. All methods and classes are appropriately commented.
8. Code is appropriately commented.
9. The program goes beyond the minimum requirements of printing "Hello World!".

I decided to start development of "Maze Mage," a text-based adventure game, for this class on Tuesday, January 18, 2022.
I had classes from 10 am to 9 pm Wednesday the 19th and this project was due at 9:30 am on Thursday the 20th.

I plan to continue development in this game in my spare time after my graduation or later in my school career.

As it currently stands (Thursday, January 20th, 2022 @ 1:29 AM) the game has a lot of infrastructure in place which is not yet implemented.
This means that most of the functionality of the game does not work at the current moment, including casting spells, generating the world, loading individual maze rooms from a data file, spawning items, spell scrolls, and enemies, movement, damage, and win or loss conditions.

As it stands, the project more than suffices for the task of "making a text-based python program."

This is not compiled into a single packaged executable right now. The file which contains the main method is "Game.py" located in the "text_adventure" package.
